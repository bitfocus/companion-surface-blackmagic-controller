## Blackmagic Controllers

It is possible to use a few of the Blackmagic Design USB/bluetooth controllers with Companion.

We currently support the following models:

- ATEM Micro Panel
- Resolve Replay Editor
- Resolve Speed Editor

This should work over both USB and Bluetooth, but we recommend using USB for the reliability.

Danger: Do not run the ATEM software at the same time when using the ATEM Micro Panel — both programs will listen to presses and update colours.

The layout matches the device's natural grid when blank spaces are compacted. The T-bar occupies a column in this layout.

To use the T-bar, go to the surface settings and select a custom variable to receive the value. You can also provide an expression to control how the T-bar LEDs are lit.
